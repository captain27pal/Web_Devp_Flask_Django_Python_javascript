Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

There are five pages. 
page1: Home page with only two sections. Each section has been assigned #id and linked to a href.

Has a list as well at the bottom.

page2: it has an image, a table and a list. Styling has been done using a .css file named style1.css.

page3: Has more styling elements. such as @media, used multiple #id and classes for styling. Have used selection to highlight selected content.there is a section which will not be displayed while taking a print out.
used elemens such as <span>,@media,<form>,<input>,<datalist> etc. ALso there is a nested list in the page.

page4: This is the Borstrap page. The styling has been done by passing a stylesheet linked to a bootsrap url.
.Follows grid structure. Has BS design elements for buttons/alerts as well. like other pages, this page is also linked to the other pages as well.

Page5: This page is built to demonstrate SCSS styling including variable and inheritance.
Have defined the styling in a .SCSS file instead of a .css file. Used a variable $color and demomstrated inheritance by including the common part of the design in %common_msg and then extending the same to other class elemens such as .inh1 and .inh2. .inh1 and inh2 classsed have their own styling as well.
Thanks you very much for going through the document.
